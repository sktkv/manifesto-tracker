## Bharavase

### What is this?
Bharavase means ‘trust’ in Kannada. Fundamentally, this website is intended to hold governments accountable to their citizens by shining a light on the progress they’ve made on their electoral promises. The larger ambition is to re-align those in power to democratic principles of transparency, participation and equity, and to re-orient citizens to judging their leaders by tangible metrics rather than jingoism. 

### Who can use this? 
The website allows for two use cases, admin and citizen. The admin can add and edit promise statuses and the citizen can view and comment on them.  

### Where's the database?
I've used XAMPP and MySQL for this. The database can be downloaded from manifeso.sql

### How do you use it?
#### Use Case: Active Citizen 
A non-registered user first enters the homepage. On the left is a dynamic pivot table and pie chart summarising the statuses of the manifesto promises given. It tracks how many promises have been fulfilled, how many are currently in progress, how many are yet to start, how many are broken, and how many have been stalled. Above the charts is a counter of the number of days the current government has been in power.

Below the data summary section is a table with each promise listed out and colour-coded according to the current status of the promise. The date column indicates the last date of updates. Clicking on ‘Details’ on each promise row takes the user to the promise-specific page, which lists down the name of the promise, status, last update, and other details.
